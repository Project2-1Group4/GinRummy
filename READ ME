first import gradle!

To run visuals go to deskoptop launcher ( usual way with libgdx projects)
To play against bot, fill in 'greedy' or 'minimax' for player name in the menu

To test bots against each other without visuals for multiple games go temp > Extra > Tests > Tests
Option of 'MinimaxPruningAI()', 'basicGreedyTest()' and 'meltBuildingGreedy()'

To test bots against each other without visuals for just 1 game go temp > gameplayers> miniMaxPruningAI, the main method (somewhere in the middle)
Again you can decide which bots play against each other by filling in one of the three options mentioned above.

Change depth of MCTS in temp > gameplayers> miniMaxPruningAI,  instance field at the top
